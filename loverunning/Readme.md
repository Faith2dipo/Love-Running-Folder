Hi and welcome to my HTML and CSS project. 

This is a fully responsive website that showcases the features of HTML5 and CSS that I have worked with up until this point. 

The Love Running website is an imagined website for a local running community. The site contains basic information for runners who may wish to drop in for a
run or a social meetup at specific times and locations. 
The site also links any additional social media presence the running group might have.
The site is comprised of three pages; Home, Gallery, and Signup. While the Home page contains the highest priority information such as the meetup times
and motivational messages, the Gallery page reinforces the sense of community and inclusion by displaying images of the runners on a virtual photo wall. For
consistency of user experience the site's logo, navigation links, and social media links on the page footer are repeated across the site pages. 

The Love Running website is a responsive website. That means that the site will maintain its integrity of design and layout when viewed on desktop, tablet or mobile
devices. The site elements will rearrange themselves according to the current browser screen width available to it and the finished site will allow for three
different screen widths to maintain the consistency of design and information presentation.
